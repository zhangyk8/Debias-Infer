# Efficient Inference on High-Dimensional Linear Models With Missing Outcomes

This package implement the proposed debiasing method for conducting valid inference on the high-dimensional linear regression function with missing outcomes. We also document all the code for the simulations and real-applications in our paper [here](https://github.com/zhangyk8/Debias-Infer/tree/main/Paper_Code).
